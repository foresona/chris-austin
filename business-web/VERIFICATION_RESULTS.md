## 🎯 How to Confirm Self-Hosted Mode Works

Since you're currently in **local mode**, here's how to test the self-hosted functionality:

### Step 1: Switch to Self-Hosted Mode

Edit `.env.local`:
```bash
# Change this line from:
TINA_PUBLIC_IS_LOCAL=true

# To:
TINA_PUBLIC_IS_LOCAL=false
```

### Step 2: Restart the Dev Server

```bash
# Kill the current server
pkill -f "next dev"

# Start it again
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. You should now see a **GitHub login button**
3. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
4. After authentication, you'll access the admin interface

### Step 4: Test Content Editing

1. Edit a blog post in the admin
2. Save the changes
3. Check GitHub for an automated commit
