# ‚úÖ FIXED: Testimonials Now Load from Tina CMS!

## What Was the Problem?

Before, testimonials were **hardcoded** in the page file. Even though you could edit them in Tina CMS admin and the files would update, the website was still showing the old hardcoded data.

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. Created Testimonials Loader (`/src/lib/getTestimonials.ts`)

- Reads all `.md` files from `/content/testimonials/`
- Parses the frontmatter and content
- Returns testimonials data
- `getFeaturedTestimonials()` - gets only testimonials with `featured: true`

### 2. Updated Homepage (`/src/app/page.tsx`)

- **Before**: Used hardcoded array of testimonials
- **After**: Calls `getFeaturedTestimonials()` to load from actual files
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent caching

### 3. Enabled Dynamic Rendering

The page now reloads testimonial data on each request, so your admin edits show immediately!

## How to Use It Now

### Step 1: Edit Testimonials in Admin

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. Click **"Testimonials"** in sidebar
3. Click on any testimonial (or create new)
4. Make your changes
5. **Toggle "Featured Testimonial" to ON** (important!)
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: See Your Changes

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Refresh the page** (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
3. Scroll to testimonials section
4. You should see your updated content!

## Featured vs Non-Featured

- **Featured = ON**: Shows on homepage
- **Featured = OFF**: Not shown on homepage (but saved for later)

Only testimonials with `featured: true` appear on the homepage testimonials section.

## Current Testimonials Setup

I can see you've already edited:

- ‚úÖ **Emily Rodriguez** (Art Collective) - Featured ‚úì
- ‚úÖ **Sarah Johnson** (TechStarss) - Featured ‚úì
- ‚ùì **Michael Chen** (GreenLife) - Check if featured

These will now display on your homepage with the content you edited in the admin!

## Testing Your Changes

1. **In Admin**: Edit a testimonial (change the text)
2. **Save** in admin
3. **Refresh** your homepage (`http://localhost:3000`)
4. **Check** the testimonials section - you should see your new text

## What About Other Content?

Currently working from Tina CMS:

- ‚úÖ **Testimonials** - Fully integrated (just fixed!)
- ‚úÖ **CTA Section** - Reads from `home.mdx`
- ‚è≥ **Hero Section** - Still hardcoded (can integrate next)
- ‚è≥ **Stats Section** - Still hardcoded (can integrate next)
- ‚è≥ **About Page** - Still hardcoded (can integrate next)

## Troubleshooting

### "I edited a testimonial but don't see it on homepage"

- Check that **"Featured Testimonial" is toggled ON** in admin
- Make sure you clicked **Save** in admin
- **Refresh** your browser (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check the file in `/content/testimonials/` - does it have `featured: true`?

### "I see old content"

- Clear your browser cache
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
- Restart dev server: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again

### "No testimonials show at all"

- Make sure at least one testimonial has `featured: true`
- Check terminal for any errors
- Verify files exist in `/content/testimonials/`
