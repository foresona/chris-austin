What We Do Best
We don’t just deliver services. We help you shape perception, build trust, and stay seen in all the right ways. Here’s how we bring your story to life:
________________


Website Development
Think of your website as your digital storefront. It's the first impression for many, and we make sure it counts. We design websites that reflect who you are, what you stand for, and what your audience needs. Every page is intentional, from the words to the way it moves. Whether you're building from scratch or refreshing what you have, we help you show up with clarity and confidence.
________________


Content Development and Execution
Great content doesn't just fill space. It opens doors. We help you find your voice, shape your message, and bring it to life through stories that resonate. Whether it's blog posts, campaign copy, or internal communications, we create content that feels human and moves people to action.
________________


Social Media Management
Social media should feel like a conversation, not a chore. We take the pressure off your plate and help you show up consistently with content that fits your tone, speaks to your audience, and keeps you relevant. From strategy to captions to community engagement, we manage your platforms with heart and intention.
________________


Media Relations
You have a story worth telling. We help you get it in front of the right people. With deep media connections and a knack for timing, we pitch, place, and position your brand in spaces that build credibility and spark interest. Whether you're looking for a feature, a quote, or a spotlight, we make sure the press sees what you’re about.
________________


Crisis Communication
When things go quiet or spiral loud, we step in with calm. We help you take control of the narrative with clear, strategic communication. Whether you're dealing with a sensitive issue, a public challenge, or reputational risk, we craft the words that help you rebuild trust and move forward without panic.
________________


Email Marketing
The inbox is a sacred space, and we treat it with care. We help you create emails that people actually want to read. From welcome series to product updates to newsletters that don't get ignored, we turn emails into moments that connect, inform, and convert.
________________


Branding
Your brand is more than your logo or colors. It’s the promise you make and the feeling you leave behind. We help you define what your brand truly is, then build everything around it—from tone to visuals to experience. When you're clear about who you are, everything else becomes easier to communicate.
________________


Go-to-Market Strategy
A strong launch doesn’t happen by luck. We help you plan, prepare, and position your brand or product for a meaningful entrance. Whether you’re introducing something new or reintroducing what’s evolved, we guide your messaging, audience strategy, and timing to make sure you don’t just show up, you stand out.
________________


Graphic Design
People notice what looks good, but they remember what feels right. We design with both in mind. From social posts to pitch decks to event materials, we create visuals that carry your message clearly and beautifully. Every design decision supports your brand’s story.




Our Story (About Us)

We started ChrisAustin because we kept hearing the same story —
“We have something good. But no one knows about it.”
Small businesses, early-stage startups, and companies across Africa and other emerging markets are building incredible things. But many don’t have the time, budget, or know-how to navigate marketing and PR.
We’ve been there — in rooms where vision was abundant but visibility was missing.
That’s where we come in.
We’re not a big agency. We’re a focused team that knows how to turn small budgets into big results. We mix street smarts with strategy, and we don’t stop until your message lands where it matters.
Because if you’re building something worth seeing, the world should see it.

Who We Work With
You’ve got the grit. The product. The ambition.
Now, you need the spotlight.
We work with:
   * Early-stage founders looking to launch right

   * Small teams trying to do it all

   * Brands ready to go from local to global

If you’re doing the hard part — building — we’ll do our part: making sure people care.
